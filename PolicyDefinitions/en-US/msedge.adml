If you enable this policy, Microsoft Edge Application Guard ignores other sources of proxy configurations.

If you don't configure this policy, Microsoft Edge Application Guard uses the proxy configuration of the host.

This policy does not affect the proxy configuration of Microsoft Edge outside of Application Guard (on the host).

The ProxyMode field lets you specify the proxy server used by Microsoft Edge Application Guard.

The ProxyPacUrl field is a URL to a proxy .pac file.

The ProxyServer field is a URL for the proxy server.

If you choose the 'direct' value as 'ProxyMode', all other fields are ignored.

If you choose the 'auto_detect' value as 'ProxyMode', all other fields are ignored.

If you choose the 'fixed_servers' value as 'ProxyMode', the 'ProxyServer' field is used.

If you choose the 'pac_script' value as 'ProxyMode', the 'ProxyPacUrl' field is used.

If 'ManagedFavorites' (Configure favorites) are configured, those favorites will also be synced to the container.

If you enable this policy, editing favorites in the container is disabled. So, the add favorites and add favorites folder buttons will be blurred out in the UI of the container browser.

If you disable or don't configure this policy, favorites on the host will not be shared to the container.</string><string id="ApplicationGuardPassiveModeEnabled">Ignore Application Guard site list configuration and browse Edge normally</string><string id="ApplicationGuardPassiveModeEnabled_Explain">Set whether Edge should ignore the Application Guard site list configuration for trusted and untrusted sites.

If you enable this policy, all navigations from Edge, including navigations to untrusted sites, will be accessed normally within Edge without redirecting to the Application Guard container. Note: this policy ONLY impacts Edge, so navigations from other browsers might get redirected to the Application Guard Container if you have the corresponding extensions enabled.

If you disable or don't configure this policy, Edge does not ignore the Application Guard site list.

Independent of the filter, only certificates that match the server's certificate request are selected.

Examples for the usage of the $FILTER section:

* When $FILTER is set to { &quot;ISSUER&quot;: { &quot;CN&quot;: &quot;$ISSUER_CN&quot; } }, only client certificates issued by a certificate with the CommonName $ISSUER_CN are selected.

* When $FILTER contains both the &quot;ISSUER&quot; and the &quot;SUBJECT&quot; sections, only client certificates that satisfy both conditions are selected.

* When $FILTER contains a &quot;SUBJECT&quot; section with the &quot;O&quot; value, a certificate needs at least one organization matching the specified value to be selected.

* When $FILTER contains a &quot;SUBJECT&quot; section with a &quot;OU&quot; value, a certificate needs at least one organizational unit matching the specified value to be selected.

* When $FILTER is set to {}, the selection of client certificates is not additionally restricted. Note that filters provided by the web server still apply.

If you leave the policy unset, there's no autoselection for any site.

If you still require legacy cookie behavior, please use 'LegacySameSiteCookieBehaviorEnabledForDomainList' (Revert to legacy SameSite behavior for cookies on specified sites) to configure behavior on a per-domain basis.

Lets you revert all cookies to legacy SameSite behavior. Reverting to legacy behavior causes cookies that don't specify a SameSite attribute to be treated as if they were &quot;SameSite=None&quot;, removes the requirement for &quot;SameSite=None&quot; cookies to carry the &quot;Secure&quot; attribute, and skips the scheme comparison when evaluating if two sites are same-site.

If you don't set this policy, the default SameSite behavior for cookies will depend on other configuration sources for the SameSite-by-default feature, the Cookies-without-SameSite-must-be-secure feature, and the Schemeful Same-Site feature. These features can also be configured by a field trial or the same-site-by-default-cookies flag, the cookies-without-same-site-must-be-secure flag, or the schemeful-same-site flag in edge://flags.

Policy options mapping:

* DefaultToLegacySameSiteCookieBehavior (1) = Revert to legacy SameSite behavior for cookies on all sites

* DefaultToSameSiteByDefaultCookieBehavior (2) = Use SameSite-by-default behavior for cookies on all sites

Cookies set for domains match specified patterns will revert to legacy SameSite behavior.

Reverting to legacy behavior causes cookies that don't specify a SameSite attribute to be treated as if they were &quot;SameSite=None&quot;, removes the requirement for &quot;SameSite=None&quot; cookies to carry the &quot;Secure&quot; attribute, and skips the scheme comparison when evaluating if two sites are same-site.

If you don't set this policy, the global default value will be used. The global default will also be used for cookies on domains not covered by the patterns you specify.

The global default value can be configured using the 'LegacySameSiteCookieBehaviorEnabled' (Enable default legacy SameSite cookie behavior setting) policy. If 'LegacySameSiteCookieBehaviorEnabled' is unset, the global default value falls back to other configuration sources.

Any ID that is omitted is treated as a wildcard with one exception, and that exception is that a product ID cannot be specified without a vendor ID also being specified.

The USB permission model uses the URL of the requesting site (&quot;requesting URL&quot;) and the URL of the top-level frame site (&quot;embedding URL&quot;) to grant permission to the requesting URL to access the USB device. The requesting URL may be different than the embedding URL when the requesting site is loaded in an iframe. Therefore, the &quot;urls&quot; field can contain up to two URL strings delimited by a comma to specify the requesting and embedding URL respectively.

If you don't set this policy, there aren't any restrictions on acceptable extension and app types.

Extensions and apps which have a type that's not on the list won't be installed. Each value should be one of these strings:

* &quot;extension&quot;

* &quot;theme&quot;

* &quot;user_script&quot;

* &quot;hosted_app&quot;

See the Microsoft Edge extensions documentation for more information about these types.

Note: This policy also affects extensions and apps to be force-installed using 'ExtensionInstallForcelist' (Control which extensions are installed silently).

Policy options mapping:

* theme (theme) = Theme

* user_script (user_script) = User script

* hosted_app (hosted_app) = Hosted app

* legacy_packaged_app (legacy_packaged_app) = Legacy packaged app

Extensions already installed will be disabled if blocked, without a way for the user to enable them. After a disabled extension is removed from the blocklist it will automatically get re-enabled.

A blocklist value of '*' means all extensions are blocked unless they are explicitly listed in the allowlist.

If this policy isn't set, the user can install any extension in Microsoft Edge.

Example value:

Users can't uninstall or turn off this setting. Permissions are granted implicitly, including the enterprise.deviceAttributes and enterprise.platformKeys extension APIs. Note: These 2 APIs aren't available to apps and extensions that aren't force-installed.

If you don't set this policy, no apps or extensions are autoinstalled and users can uninstall any app in Microsoft Edge.

This policy supercedes 'ExtensionInstallBlocklist' (Control which extensions cannot be installed) policy. If a previously force-installed app or extension is removed from this list, Microsoft Edge automatically uninstalls it.

For Windows instances not joined to a Microsoft Active Directory domain, forced installation is limited to apps and extensions listed in the Microsoft Edge Add-ons website.

On macOS instances, apps and extensions from outside the Microsoft Edge Add-ons website can only be force installed if the instance is managed via MDM, or joined to a domain via MCX.

The source code of any extension can be altered by users with developer tools, potentially rendering the extension unfunctional. If this is a concern, configure the 'DeveloperToolsAvailability' (Control where developer tools can be used) policy.

Each list item of the policy is a string that contains an extension ID and, optionally, and an optional &quot;update&quot; URL separated by a semicolon (;). The extension ID is the 32-letter string found, for example, on edge://extensions when in Developer mode. If specified, the &quot;update&quot; URL should point to an Update Manifest XML document ( https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2095043 ). The update URL should use one of the following schemes: http, https or file. By default, the Microsoft Edge Add-ons website's update URL is used. The &quot;update&quot; URL set in this policy is only used for the initial installation; subsequent updates of the extension use the update URL in the extension's manifest. The update url for subsequent updates can be overridden using the ExtensionSettings policy, see https://learn.microsoft.com/deployedge/microsoft-edge-manage-extensions-ref-guide.

Note: This policy doesn't apply to InPrivate mode. Read about hosting extensions at [Publish and update extensions in the Microsoft Edge Add-ons website](/microsoft-edge/extensions-chromium/enterprise/hosting-and-updating).

Define URLs that can install extensions and themes directly without having to drag and drop the packages to the edge://extensions page.

Each item in this list is an extension-style match pattern (see https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2095039). Users can easily install items from any URL that matches an item in this list. Both the location of the *.crx file and the page where the download is started from (in other words, the referrer) must be allowed by these patterns. Do not host the files at a location that requires authentication.

The 'ExtensionInstallBlocklist' (Control which extensions cannot be installed) policy takes precedence over this policy. Any extensions that's on the block list won't be installed, even if it comes from a site on this list.

A blocklist value of * means all extensions are blocked and users can only install extensions listed in the allow list.

By default, all extensions are allowed. However, if you prohibited extensions by policy, you can use the list of allowed extensions to change that policy.

Example value:

extension_id1

Manifest v2 extensions support will be deprecated and all extensions need to be migrated to v3 in the future. More information about, and the timeline of the migration has not been established.

If the policy is set to Default or not set, v2 extension loading is decided by browser. This will follow the preceding timeline when it's established.

If the policy is set to Disable, v2 extensions installation are blocked, and existing ones are disabled. This option is going to be treated the same as if the policy is unset after v2 support is turned off by default.

If the policy is set to Enable, v2 extensions are allowed. The option is going to be treated the same as if the policy isn't set before v2 support is turned off by default.

If the policy is set to EnableForForcedExtensions, force installed v2 extensions are allowed. This includes extensions that are listed by 'ExtensionInstallForcelist' (Control which extensions are installed silently) or 'ExtensionSettings' (Configure extension management settings) with installation_mode &quot;force_installed&quot; or &quot;normal_installed&quot;. All other v2 extensions are disabled. The option is always available regardless of the manifest migration state.

Extensions availabilities are still controlled by other policies.

Policy options mapping:

* Default (0) = Default browser behavior

* Disable (1) = Manifest v2 is disabled

* Enable (2) = Manifest v2 is enabled

* EnableForForcedExtensions (3) = Manifest v2 is enabled for forced extensions only

This policy supersedes any legacy policies that might be set.

This policy maps an extension ID or an update URL to its specific setting only. A default configuration can be set for the special ID &quot;*&quot;, which applies to all extensions without a custom configuration in this policy. With an update URL, configuration applies to extensions with the exact update URL stated in the extension manifest. If the 'override_update_url' flag is set to true, the extension is installed and updated using the update URL specified in the 'ExtensionInstallForcelist' (Control which extensions are installed silently) policy or in 'update_url' field in this policy. The flag 'override_update_url' is ignored if the 'update_url' is the Edge Add-ons website update URL. For more details, check out the detailed guide to ExtensionSettings policy available at https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2161555.

To block extensions from a particular third party store, you only need to block the update_url for that store. For example, if you want to block extensions from Chrome Web Store, you can use the following JSON.

{&quot;update_url:https://clients2.google.com/service/update2/crx&quot;:{&quot;installation_mode&quot;:&quot;blocked&quot;}}

Note that you can still use 'ExtensionInstallForcelist' and 'ExtensionInstallAllowlist' (Allow specific extensions to be installed) to allow / force install specific extensions even if the store is blocked using the JSON in the previous example.

If the 'sidebar_auto_open_blocked' flag is set to true in an extension's configuration, the hub-app (sidebar app) corresponding to the specified extension will be prevented from automatically opening.

On Windows instances, apps and extensions from outside the Microsoft Edge Add-ons website can only be forced installed if the instance is joined to a Microsoft Active Directory domain or joined to Microsoft Azure Active Directory®`.

On macOS instances, apps and extensions from outside the Microsoft Edge Add-ons website can only be force installed if the instance is managed via MDM, joined to a domain via MCX.

For example, if  the &quot;vbe&quot; extension is associated with &quot;website1.com&quot;, users would not see a SmartScreen AppRep warning when downloading &quot;vbe&quot; files from &quot;website1.com&quot;, but may see a download warning when downloading &quot;vbe&quot; files from &quot;website2.com&quot;.

Files with file type extensions specified for domains identified by this policy will still be subject to file type extension-based security warnings and mixed-content download warnings.

If you disable this policy or don't configure it, files that trigger SmartScreen AppRep download warnings will show warnings to the user.

If you enable this policy:

* The URL pattern should be formatted according to https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2095322.
* The file type extension entered must be in lower-cased ASCII. The leading separator should not be included when listing the file type extension, so &quot;vbe&quot; should be used instead of &quot;.vbe&quot;.

Example:

The following example value would prevent SmartScreen AppRep warnings on msi, exe, and vbe extensions for *.contoso.com domains. It may show the user a SmartScreen AppRep warning on any other domain for exe and msi files, but not for vbe files.

[
  { &quot;file_extension&quot;: &quot;msi&quot;, &quot;domains&quot;: [&quot;contoso.com&quot;] },

  { &quot;file_extension&quot;: &quot;vbe&quot;, &quot;domains&quot;: [&quot;*&quot;] }
]

Note that while the preceding example shows the suppression of SmartScreen AppRep download warnings for &quot;vbe&quot; files for all domains, applying suppression of such warnings for all domains is not recommended due to security concerns.

Specifies the company logo to use on the new tab page in Microsoft Edge.

The policy should be configured as a string that expresses the logo(s) in JSON format.

You configure this policy by specifying the URL from which Microsoft Edge can download the logo and its cryptographic hash (SHA-256), which is used to verify the integrity of the download. The logo must be in PNG or SVG format, and its file size must not exceed 16 MB. The logo is downloaded and cached, and it will be redownloaded whenever the URL or the hash changes. The URL must be accessible without any authentication.

The 'default_logo' is required and will be used when there's no background image. If 'light_logo' is provided, it will be used when the user's new tab page has a background image. We recommend a horizontal logo with a transparent background that is left-aligned and vertically centered. The logo should have a minimum height of 32 pixels and an aspect ratio from 1:1 to 4:1. The 'default_logo' should have proper contrast against a white/black background while the 'light_logo' should have proper contrast against a background image.

If you enable this policy, Microsoft Edge downloads and shows the specified logo(s) on the new tab page. Users can't override or hide the logo(s).

If you disable or don't configure this policy, Microsoft Edge will show no company logo or a Microsoft logo on the new tab page.

AdsTransparencyEnabled will only have an effect if 'TrackingPrevention' is set to TrackingPreventionBalanced or is not configured.

If you enable or don't configure this policy, transparency metadata provided by ads will be available to the user when the feature is active.

When the feature is enabled, Tracking Prevention will enable exceptions for the associated ad providers that have met Microsoft's privacy standards.

If you disable this policy, Tracking Prevention will not adjust its behavior even when transparency metadata is provided by ads.</string><string id="AllowBackForwardCacheForCacheControlNoStorePageEnabled">Allow pages with Cache-Control: no-store header to enter back/forward cache</string><string id="AllowBackForwardCacheForCacheControlNoStorePageEnabled_Explain">This policy controls if a page with Cache-Control: no-store header can be stored in back/forward cache. The website setting this header may not expect the page to be restored from back/forward cache since some sensitive information could still be displayed after the restoration even if it is no longer accessible.

If you enable or don't configure this policy, the page with Cache-Control: no-store header might be restored from back/forward cache unless the cache eviction is triggered (e.g. when there is HTTP-only cookie change to the site).

If you disable this policy, the page with Cache-Control: no-store header will not be stored in back/forward cache.</string><string id="AllowDeletingBrowserHistory">Enable deleting browser and download history</string><string id="AllowDeletingBrowserHistory_Explain">Enables deleting browser history and download history and prevents users from changing this setting.

Note that even with this policy is disabled, the browsing and download history aren't guaranteed to be retained: users can edit or delete the history database files directly, and the browser itself may remove (based on expiration period) or archive any or all history items at any time.

If you enable this policy or don't configure it, users can delete the browsing and download history.

If you disable this policy, users can't delete browsing and download history. Disabling this policy will disable history sync and open tab sync.

If you enable this policy, don't enable the 'ClearBrowsingDataOnExit' (Clear browsing data when Microsoft Edge closes) policy, because they both deal with deleting data. If you enable both, the 'ClearBrowsingDataOnExit' policy takes precedence and deletes all data when Microsoft Edge closes, regardless of how this policy is configured.</string><string id="AllowFileSelectionDialogs">Allow file selection dialogs</string><string id="AllowFileSelectionDialogs_Explain">Allow access to local files by letting Microsoft Edge display file selection dialogs.

If you enable or don't configure this policy, users can open file selection dialogs as normal.

This policy is obsolete because it was only intended to be a short-term mechanism to give enterprises more time to update their web content if and when it was found to be incompatible with the change to disallow synchronous XHR requests during page dismissal. It doesn't work in Microsoft Edge after version 99.

This policy lets you specify that a page can send synchronous XHR requests during page dismissal.

If you enable this policy, pages can send synchronous XHR requests during page dismissal.

Users can only access Google tools using accounts from the specified domains. To allow gmail or googlemail accounts, add consumer_accounts to the list of domains. This policy is based on the Chrome policy of the same name.

If you don't provide a domain name or leave this policy unset, users can access Google Workspace with any account.

Users cannot change or override this setting.

Note: This policy causes the X-GoogApps-Allowed-Domains header to be appended to all HTTP and HTTPS requests to all google.com domains, as described in https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2197973.

If you enable this policy, a web service is used to generate url and search suggestions for network errors.

If you disable this policy, no calls to the web service are made and a standard error page is shown.

If you don't configure this policy, Microsoft Edge respects the user preference that's set under Services at edge://settings/privacy.
Specifically, there's a **Suggest similar pages when a webpage can't be found** toggle, which the user can switch on or off. Note that if you have enable this policy (AlternateErrorPagesEnabled), the Suggest similar pages when a webpage can't be found setting is turned on, but the user can't change the setting by using the toggle. If you disable this policy, the Suggest similar pages when a webpage can't be found setting is turned off, and the user can't change the setting by using the toggle.</string><string id="AlwaysOpenPdfExternally">Always open PDF files externally</string><string id="AlwaysOpenPdfExternally_Explain">Disables the internal PDF viewer in Microsoft Edge.

If you enable this policy Microsoft Edge treats PDF files as downloads and lets users open them with the default application.

If Microsoft Edge is the default PDF reader, PDF files aren't downloaded and will continue to open in Microsoft Edge.

Ambient Authentication is http authentication with default credentials when explicit credentials aren't provided via NTLM/Kerberos/Negotiate challenge/response schemes.

If you set the policy to 'RegularOnly', it allows ambient authentication for Regular sessions only. InPrivate and Guest sessions won't be allowed to ambiently authenticate.

If you set the policy to 'InPrivateAndRegular', it allows ambient authentication for InPrivate and Regular sessions. Guest sessions won't be allowed to ambiently authenticate.

If you set the policy to 'GuestAndRegular', it allows ambient authentication for Guest and Regular sessions. InPrivate sessions won't be allowed to ambiently authenticate

If you set the policy to 'All', it allows ambient authentication for all sessions.

Note that ambient authentication is always allowed on regular profiles.

Disabling this policy has a detrimental effect on Microsoft Edge's security because unknown and potentially hostile apps can retrieve the encryption keys used to secure data.

Only turn off this policy if there are compatibility issues, such as scenarios where other applications need legitimate access to Microsoft Edge's data. Encrypted user data is expected to be fully portable between different computers or the integrity and location of Microsoft Edge's executable files isn’t consistent.</string><string id="ApplicationLocaleValue">Set application locale</string><string id="ApplicationLocaleValue_Explain">Configures the application locale in Microsoft Edge and prevents users from changing the locale.

If you enable this policy, Microsoft Edge uses the specified locale. If the configured locale isn't supported, 'en-US' is used instead.

If you disable or don't configure this setting, Microsoft Edge uses either the user-specified preferred locale (if configured) or the fallback locale 'en-US'.

Example value: en</string><string id="AskBeforeCloseEnabled">Get user confirmation before closing a browser window with multiple tabs</string><string id="AskBeforeCloseEnabled_Explain">This policy lets you configure whether users see a confirmation dialog before closing a browser window with multiple tabs. This dialog asks users to confirm that the browser window can be closed.

If you enable this policy, users will be presented with a confirmation dialog when closing a browser window with multiple tabs.

This policy applies to all URLs except for those configured in the 'AudioCaptureAllowedUrls' (Sites that can access audio capture devices without requesting permission) list.

If you enable this policy or don't configure it (the default setting), the user is prompted for audio capture access except from the URLs in the 'AudioCaptureAllowedUrls' list. These listed URLs are granted access without prompting.

If you disable this policy, the user is not prompted, and audio capture is accessible only to the URLs configured in 'AudioCaptureAllowedUrls'.

This policy affects all types of audio inputs, not only the built-in microphone.</string><string id="AudioCaptureAllowedUrls">Sites that can access audio capture devices without requesting permission</string><string id="AudioCaptureAllowedUrls_Explain">Specify websites, based on URL patterns, that can use audio capture devices without asking the user for permission.

If you enable this policy, the audio process will run sandboxed.

If you disable this policy, the audio process will run unsandboxed and the WebRTC audio-processing module will run in the renderer process.
This leaves users open to security risks related to running the audio subsystem unsandboxed.

If you don't configure this policy, the default configuration for the audio sandbox will be used, which might differ based on the platform.

This policy is intended to give enterprises flexibility to disable the audio sandbox if they use security software setups that interfere with the sandbox.</string><string id="AutoImportAtFirstRun">Automatically import another browser's data and settings at first run</string><string id="AutoImportAtFirstRun_Explain">If you enable this policy, all supported datatypes and settings from the specified browser will be silently and automatically imported at first run. During the First Run Experience, the import section will also be skipped.

The browser data from Microsoft Edge Legacy will always be silently migrated at the first run, irrespective of the value of this policy.

If this policy is set to 'FromDefaultBrowser', then the datatypes corresponding to the default browser on the managed device will be imported.

If the browser specified as the value of this policy is not present in the managed device, Microsoft Edge will simply skip the import without any notification to the user.

If you set this policy to 'DisabledAutoImport', the import section of the first-run experience is skipped entirely and Microsoft Edge doesn't import browser data and settings automatically.

If this policy is set to the value of 'FromInternetExplorer', the following datatypes will be imported from Internet Explorer:
1. Favorites or bookmarks
2. Saved passwords
3. Search engines

Note: For more details on what is imported from Google Chrome, please see https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2120835

If this policy is set to the value of 'FromSafari', user data is no longer imported into Microsoft Edge. This is due to the way Full Disk Access works on Mac.
On macOS Mojave and above, it's no longer possible to have automated and unattended import of Safari data into Microsoft Edge.

Starting with Microsoft Edge version 83, if this policy is set to the value of 'FromMozillaFirefox', the following datatypes will be imported from Mozilla Firefox:
1. Favorites or bookmarks
2. Saved passwords
3. Addresses and more
4. Browsing History

If you want to restrict specific datatypes from getting imported on the managed devices, you can use this policy with other policies such as 'ImportAutofillFormData' (Allow importing of autofill form data), 'ImportBrowserSettings' (Allow importing of browser settings), 'ImportFavorites' (Allow importing of favorites), and etc.

The trailing separator should not be included when listing the protocol and the protocol should be all lower case. For example, list &quot;skype&quot; instead of &quot;skype:&quot;, &quot;skype://&quot; or &quot;Skype&quot;.

If you configure this policy, a protocol will only be permitted to launch an external application without prompting by policy if:

- the protocol is listed

- the origin of the site trying to launch the protocol matches one of the origin patterns in that protocol's allowed_origins list.

If either condition is false, the external protocol launch prompt will not be omitted by policy.

If you don't configure this policy, no protocols can launch without a prompt. Users can opt out of prompts on a per-protocol/per-site basis unless the 'ExternalProtocolDialogShowAlwaysOpenCheckbox' (Show an &quot;Always open&quot; checkbox in external protocol dialog) policy is set to Disabled. This policy has no impact on per-protocol/per-site prompt exemptions set by users.

The origin matching patterns use a similar format to those for the 'URLBlocklist' (Block access to a list of URLs) policy, which are documented at https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2095322.

However, origin matching patterns for this policy cannot contain &quot;/path&quot; or &quot;@query&quot; elements. Any pattern that does contain a &quot;/path&quot; or &quot;@query&quot; element will be ignored.

This policy lets you disable Certificate Transparency disclosure requirements for certificate chains that contain certificates with one of the specified subjectPublicKeyInfo hashes. This allows certificates that would otherwise be untrusted because they were not properly publicly disclosed to still be used for Enterprise hosts.

To disable Certificate Transparency enforcement when this policy is set, one of the following sets of conditions must be met:
1. The hash is of the server certificate's subjectPublicKeyInfo.
2. The hash is of a subjectPublicKeyInfo that appears in a CA certificate in the certificate chain, that CA certificate is constrained via the X.509v3 nameConstraints extension, one or more directoryName nameConstraints are present in the permittedSubtrees, and the directoryName contains an organizationName attribute.
3. The hash is of a subjectPublicKeyInfo that appears in a CA certificate in the certificate chain, the CA certificate has one or more organizationName attributes in the certificate Subject, and the server's certificate contains the same number of organizationName attributes, in the same order, and with byte-for-byte identical values.

A subjectPublicKeyInfo hash is specified by concatenating the hash algorithm name, the &quot;/&quot; character, and the Base64 encoding of that hash algorithm applied to the DER-encoded subjectPublicKeyInfo of the specified certificate. This Base64 encoding is the same format as an SPKI Fingerprint, as defined in RFC 7469, Section 2.4. Unrecognized hash algorithms are ignored.

This policy lets you disable Certificate Transparency disclosure requirements for certificate chains that contain certificates with one of the specified subjectPublicKeyInfo hashes. This allows certificates that would otherwise be untrusted because they were not properly publicly disclosed, continue to be used for enterprise hosts.

In order for Certificate Transparency enforcement to be disabled, you must set the hash to a subjectPublicKeyInfo appearing in a CA certificate that is recognized as a legacy certificate authority (CA). A legacy CA is a CA that has been publicly trusted by default by one or more operating systems supported by Microsoft Edge.

You specify a subjectPublicKeyInfo hash by concatenating the hash algorithm name, the &quot;/&quot; character, and the Base64 encoding of that hash algorithm applied to the DER-encoded subjectPublicKeyInfo of the specified certificate.

If you set this policy to &quot;Limited&quot;, the OS Regional format will only be shared if its language part matches the Microsoft Edge display language.

If you set this policy to &quot;Always&quot;, the OS Regional format will always be shared. This value could cause unexpected website behavior if the OS Regional format language is different from the Microsoft Edge display language. For example, if a website uses the JavaScript default locale to format dates, the names of the days and months can be displayed in one language while the surrounding text is displayed in another language.

If you set this policy to &quot;Never&quot;, the OS Regional format will never be shared.

Example 1: In this example the OS Regional format is set to &quot;en-GB&quot; and the browser display language is set to &quot;en-US&quot;. Then the OS Regional format will be shared if the policy is set to &quot;Limited&quot;, or &quot;Always&quot;.

This setting is intended for the scenario where the browser home page should load in Internet Explorer mode, and it is important that is does so on browser first run after IE mode is enabled. If this scenario does not exist, we recommend not enabling this setting because it can negatively impact the performance of loading the home page.

The timeout behavior of this policy can be configured with the 'NavigationDelayForInitialSiteListDownloadTimeout' (Set a timeout for delay of tab navigation for the Enterprise Mode Site List) policy.

If you set this policy to 'All', when Microsoft Edge does not have a cached version of the Enterprise Mode Site List, tabs delay navigating until the browser has downloaded the site list. Sites configured to open in Internet Explorer mode by the site list will load in Internet Explorer mode, even during the initial navigation of the browser. Sites that cannot possibly be configured to open in Internet Explorer, such as any site with a scheme other than http:, https:, file:, or ftp: do not delay navigating and load immediately in Edge mode.

When used in conjunction with the 'InternetExplorerIntegrationCloudSiteList' policy, during first launch of Microsoft Edge, there is a delay because implicit sign-in needs to finish before Microsoft Edge attempts to download the site list from the Microsoft cloud, since this requires authentication to the cloud service.

If you set this policy to 'None' or don't configure it, when Microsoft Edge does not have a cached version of the Enterprise Mode Site List, tabs will navigate immediately, and not wait for the browser to download the Enterprise Mode Site List.

If you don't configure or disable this policy, it potentially allows web pages to use the WebGL API and plug-ins to use the Pepper 3D API. Microsoft Edge might, by default, still require command line arguments to be passed in order to use these APIs.

If 'HardwareAccelerationModeEnabled' (Use graphics acceleration when available) policy is set to false, the setting for 'Disable3DAPIs' policy is ignored - it's the equivalent of setting 'Disable3DAPIs' policy to true.</string><string id="DisableScreenshots">Disable taking screenshots</string><string id="DisableScreenshots_Explain">Controls if users can take screenshots of the browser page.

If you enable this policy, users can't take screenshots using keyboard shortcuts or extension APIs.

If you disable or don't configure this policy, users can take screenshots.

Note: Even if you disable screenshots using this policy, users might still be able to take screenshots using Web Capture within the browser or other methods outside of the browser. For example, using an operating system feature or another application.</string><string id="DiscoverPageContextEnabled">Enable Discover access to page contents for AAD profiles (obsolete)</string><string id="DiscoverPageContextEnabled_Explain">OBSOLETE: This policy is obsolete and doesn't work after Microsoft Edge 127.

This policy has been obsoleted as of Edge 127. Two new Edge Policies have taken its place. Those policies are CopilotPageContext (Control Copilot access to page contents for AAD profiles), and CopilotCDPPageContext (Control Copilot with Commercial Data Protection access to page contents for AAD profiles).

This policy did not allow for separate control of Copilot and Copilot with Commercial Data Protection. The new policies allow separate control of these versions of Copilot. The new policies also allow admins to force-enable Copilot access to Edge page contents by enabling the policy, whereas DiscoverPageContextEnabled only allowed force-disabling of Copilot page access.

This policy controls Discover access to page contents for AAD profiles. Discover is an extension that hosts Bing Chat. In order to summarize pages and interact with text selections, it needs to be able to access the page contents. When enabled, page contents will be sent to Bing. This policy does not affect MSA profiles.

If you enable or don't configure this policy, Discover will have access to page contents.

If you disable this policy, Discover will not be able to access page contents.</string><string id="DiskCacheDir">Set disk cache directory</string><string id="DiskCacheDir_Explain">Configures the directory to use to store cached files.

If you enable this policy, Microsoft Edge uses the provided directory regardless of whether the user has specified the '--disk-cache-dir' flag. To avoid data loss or other unexpected errors, don't configure this policy to a volume's root directory or to a directory used for other purposes, because Microsoft Edge manages its contents.

See https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2095041 for a list of variables you can use when specifying directories and paths.

If you don't configure this policy, the default cache directory is used, and users can override that default with the '--disk-cache-dir' command line flag.

Example value: ${user_home}/Edge_cache</string><string id="DiskCacheSize">Set disk cache size, in bytes</string><string id="DiskCacheSize_Explain">Configures the size of the cache, in bytes, used to store files on the disk.

If you enable this policy, Microsoft Edge uses the provided cache size regardless of whether the user has specified the '--disk-cache-size' flag. The value specified in this policy isn't a hard boundary but rather a suggestion to the caching system; any value below a few megabytes is too small and will be rounded up to a reasonable minimum.

If you set the value of this policy to 0, the default cache size is used, and users can't change it.

If you don't configure this policy, the default size is used, but users can override it with the '--disk-cache-size' flag.

Note: The value specified in this policy is used as a hint to various cache subsystems in the browser. The aggregate disk usage of all caches may therefore be larger than (but within the same order of magnitude as) the value specified.</string><string id="DisplayCapturePermissionsPolicyEnabled">Specifies whether the display-capture permissions-policy is checked or skipped (obsolete)</string><string id="DisplayCapturePermissionsPolicyEnabled_Explain">OBSOLETE: This policy is obsolete and doesn't work after Microsoft Edge 109.

This policy is obsolete. The policy was a temporary workaround for non-spec-compliant enterprise applications.

This policy stopped working in Microsoft Edge 107 and was obsoleted in Microsoft Edge 110.

The display-capture permissions-policy gates access to getDisplayMedia(),
as per this spec:
https://www.w3.org/TR/screen-capture/#feature-policy-integration
However, if this policy is Disabled, this requirement is not enforced,
and getDisplayMedia() is allowed from contexts that would otherwise be
forbidden.

If you enable or don't configure this policy, sites can only call getDisplayMedia() from
contexts which are allowlisted by the display-capture permissions-policy.

If you disable this policy, sites can call getDisplayMedia() even from contexts
which are not allowlisted by the display-capture permissions policy.
Note that other restrictions may still apply.</string><string id="DnsOverHttpsMode">Control the mode of DNS-over-HTTPS</string><string id="DnsOverHttpsMode_Explain">Control the mode of the DNS-over-HTTPS resolver. Note that this policy will only set the default mode for each query.
The mode can be overridden for special types of queries such as requests to resolve a DNS-over-HTTPS server hostname.

The &quot;off&quot; mode will disable DNS-over-HTTPS.

The &quot;automatic&quot; mode will send DNS-over-HTTPS queries first if a DNS-over-HTTPS server is available and may fallback to sending insecure queries on error.

The &quot;secure&quot; mode will only send DNS-over-HTTPS queries and will fail to resolve on error.

If this policy is not configured for managed devices, DNS-over-HTTPS queries will not be sent. Instead, the browser
may send DNS requests to a resolver associated with the user's system resolver.
This could lead to a less secure or private DNS resolution process, depending on the resolver in use.

Policy options mapping:

* off (off) = Disable DNS-over-HTTPS

* automatic (automatic) = Enable DNS-over-HTTPS with insecure fallback

* secure (secure) = Enable DNS-over-HTTPS without insecure fallback

If you set 'DnsOverHttpsMode' to &quot;automatic&quot; and this policy is set then the URI templates specified will be used. If you don't set this policy, then hardcoded mappings will be used to attempt to upgrade the user's current DNS resolver to a DoH resolver operated by the same provider.

If the URI template contains a dns variable, requests to the resolver will use GET; otherwise requests will use POST.

These origins won't be silently blocked from launching an external application by anti-flood protection. The trailing separator shouldn't be included when listing the protocol. For example, list &quot;skype&quot; instead of &quot;skype:&quot; or &quot;skype://&quot;.

If you configure this policy, a protocol will only be permitted to bypass being silently blocked by anti-flood protection if:

- the protocol is listed

- the origin of the site trying to launch the protocol matches one of the origin patterns in that protocol's allowed_origins list.

If either condition is false, the external protocol launch may be blocked by anti-flood protection.

If you don't configure this policy, no protocols can bypass being silently blocked.

The origin matching patterns use a similar format to those for the 'URLBlocklist' (Block access to a list of URLs) policy, that are documented at https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2095322.

However, origin matching patterns for this policy cannot contain &quot;/path&quot; or &quot;@query&quot; elements. Any pattern that does contain a &quot;/path&quot; or &quot;@query&quot; element will be ignored.

This policy doesn't work because conflicting states should be avoided. This policy was used to enable/disable download of the domain actions list, but it didn't always achieve the desired state. The Experimentation and Configuration Service, which handles the download, has its own policy to configure what is downloaded from the service. Use the 'ExperimentationAndConfigurationServiceControl' (Control communication with the Experimentation and Configuration Service) policy instead.

In Microsoft Edge, Domain Actions represent a series of compatibility features that help the browser work correctly on the web.

Microsoft keeps a list of actions to take on certain domains for compatibility reasons. For example, the browser may override the User Agent string on a website if that website is broken due to the new User Agent string on Microsoft Edge. Each of these actions is intended to be temporary while Microsoft tries to resolve the issue with the site owner.

When the browser starts up and then periodically afterwards, the browser will contact the Experimentation and Configuration Service that contains the most up to date list of compatibility actions to perform. This list is saved locally after it is first retrieved so that subsequent requests will only update the list if the server's copy has changed.

If you enable this policy, the list of Domain Actions will continue to be downloaded from the Experimentation and Configuration Service.

Note that this policy depends on the operating system (OS) certificate verification stack allowing SHA-1 signatures. If an OS update changes the OS handling of SHA-1 certificates, this policy might no longer have effect.  Further, this policy is intended as a temporary workaround to give enterprises more time to move away from SHA-1. This policy will be removed in Microsoft Edge 92 releasing in mid 2021.

This policy exists as a temporary opt-out in case an enterprise encounters issues with the constraints encoded in their private roots. In that case this policy may be used to temporarily disable enforcement of the constraints while correcting the certificate issues.

If you enable this policy or don't configure it, Microsoft Edge will enforce constraints encoded into trust anchors loaded from the platform trust store.

If you disable this policy, Microsoft Edge will not enforce constraints encoded into trust anchors loaded from the platform trust store.

This policy has been obsoleted in favor of 'ExemptFileTypeDownloadWarnings' (Disable download file type extension-based warnings for specified file types on domains) because of a type mismatch that caused errors in Mac.

You can enable this policy to create a dictionary of file type extensions with a corresponding list of domains that will be exempted from file type extension-based download warnings. This lets enterprise administrators block file type extension-based download warnings for files that are associated with a listed domain. For example, if  the &quot;jnlp&quot; extension is associated with &quot;website1.com&quot;, users would not see a warning when downloading &quot;jnlp&quot; files from &quot;website1.com&quot;, but see a download warning when downloading &quot;jnlp&quot; files from &quot;website2.com&quot;.

Files with file type extensions specified for domains identified by this policy will still be subject to non-file type extension-based security warnings such as mixed-content download warnings and Microsoft Defender SmartScreen warnings.

If you disable this policy or don't configure it, file types that trigger extension-based download warnings will show warnings to the user.

If you enable this policy:

* The URL pattern should be formatted according to https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2095322.
* The file type extension entered must be in lower-cased ASCII. The leading separator should not be included when listing the file type extension, so list &quot;jnlp&quot; should be used instead of &quot;.jnlp&quot;.

Example:

The following example value would prevent file type extension-based download warnings on swf, exe, and jnlp extensions for *.contoso.com domains. It will show the user a file type extension-based download warning on any other domain for exe and jnlp files, but not for swf files.

This policy was removed in Microsoft Edge 118 and is ignored if configured.

This policy controls whether the User-Agent string major
version should be frozen at 99.

The User-Agent request header lets websites identify the application,
operating system, vendor, and/or version of the requesting user agent.
Some websites make assumptions about how this header is formatted and may
encounter issues with version strings that include three digits in the
major position (for example, 100.0.0.0).

Setting the policy to 'Default' or leaving it unset will default to
browser settings for the User-Agent string major version.
If set to 'ForceEnabled', the User-Agent string will always report the
major version as 99 and include the browser's major version in the minor
position. For example, browser version 101.0.0.0 would send a User-Agent
request header that reports version 99.101.0.0.
If set to 'ForceDisabled', the User-Agent string will not freeze the
major version.

This policy is temporary and will be deprecated in the future. Note that

Pages might depend on unload event handlers to save data or signal the end of a user session to the server.
This is not recommended because it's unreliable and impacts performance by blocking use of BackForwardCache.
Recommended alternatives exist, but the unload event has been used for a long time. Some applications might still rely on them.

If you disable this policy or don't configure it, unload event handlers will gradually be deprecated in-line with the deprecation rollout and sites which don't set Permissions-Policy header will stop firing `unload` events.

You can provide one of the following data types for this policy: &quot;favorites&quot;, &quot;settings&quot;, &quot;passwords&quot;, &quot;addressesAndMore&quot;, &quot;extensions&quot;, &quot;history&quot;, &quot;openTabs&quot;, &quot;edgeWallet&quot;, &quot;collections&quot;, &quot;apps&quot;, and &quot;edgeFeatureUsage&quot;. The &quot;edgeFeatureUsage&quot; data type will be supported starting in Microsoft Edge version 134. Note that these data type names are case sensitive.

Users will not be able to override the enabled data types.

Set to 'Strict' to enforce Strict Restricted Mode on YouTube.

Set to 'Moderate' to enforce the user to only use Moderate Restricted Mode and Strict Restricted Mode on YouTube. They can't disable Restricted Mode.

Set to 'Off' or don't configure this policy to not enforce Restricted Mode on YouTube. External policies such as YouTube policies might still enforce Restricted Mode.

Policy options mapping:

* Off (0) = Do not enforce Restricted Mode on YouTube

* Moderate (1) = Enforce at least Moderate Restricted Mode on YouTube

* Strict (2) = Enforce Strict Restricted Mode for YouTube

If you enable this policy or don't configure it, the user, apps, and extensions with appropriate permissions can enter full screen mode.

If you disable this policy, users, apps, and extensions can't enter full screen mode.

Opening Microsoft Edge in kiosk mode using the command line is unavailable when full screen mode is disabled.</string><string id="GloballyScopeHTTPAuthCacheEnabled">Enable globally scoped HTTP auth cache</string><string id="GloballyScopeHTTPAuthCacheEnabled_Explain">This policy configures a single global per profile cache with HTTP server authentication credentials.

If you disable or don't set this policy, the browser will use the default behavior of cross-site auth, which as of version 80, will be to scope HTTP server authentication credentials by top-level site. So, if two sites use resources from the same authenticating domain, credentials will need to be provided independently in the context of both sites. Cached proxy credentials will be reused across sites.

If you enable this policy HTTP auth credentials entered in the context of one site will automatically be used in the context of another site.

Enabling this policy leaves sites open to some types of cross-site attacks, and allows users to be tracked across sites even without cookies by adding entries to the HTTP auth cache using credentials embedded in URLs.

This policy is intended to give enterprises depending on the legacy behavior a chance to update their login procedures and will be removed in the future.</string><string id="GoToIntranetSiteForSingleWordEntryInAddressBar">Force direct intranet site navigation instead of searching on single word entries in the Address Bar</string><string id="GoToIntranetSiteForSingleWordEntryInAddressBar_Explain">If you enable this policy, the top auto-suggest result in the address bar suggestion list will navigate to intranet sites if the text entered in the address bar is a single word without punctuation.

Default navigation when typing a single word without punctuation will conduct a navigation to an intranet site matching the entered text.

If you enable this policy, the second auto-suggest result in the address bar suggestion list will conduct a web search exactly as it was entered, provided that this text is a single word without punctuation. The default search provider will be used unless a policy to prevent web search is also enabled.

Two effects of enabling this policy are:

Navigation to sites in response to single word queries that would typically resolve to a history item will no longer happen. Instead, the browser will attempt navigate to internal sites that may not exist in an organization's intranet. This will result in a 404 error.

Popular, single-word search terms will require manual selection of search suggestions to properly conduct a search.</string><string id="HSTSPolicyBypassList">Configure the list of names that will bypass the HSTS policy check</string><string id="HSTSPolicyBypassList_Explain">Setting the policy specifies a list of hostnames that bypass preloaded HSTS upgrades from http to https.

This policy does not prevent HSTS upgrades for servers that have dynamically requested HSTS upgrades using a Strict-Transport-Security response header.

Supplied hostnames must be canonicalized: Any IDNs must be converted to their A-label format, and all ASCII letters must be lowercase. This policy only applies to the specific single-label hostnames specified, not to subdomains of those names.

For the configuration options shown in the First Run Experience, the browser will default to the following:

-On the New Tab Page, the feed type will be set to MSN News and the layout to Inspirational.

-The user will still be automatically signed into Microsoft Edge if the Windows account is of Azure AD or MSA type.

-Sync will not be enabled by default and users will be prompted to choose whether they'd like to sync on browser startup. You can use the 'ForceSync' (Force synchronization of browser data and do not show the sync consent prompt) or the 'SyncDisabled' (Disable synchronization of data using Microsoft sync services) policy to configure sync and the sync consent prompt.

If you disable or don't configure this policy, the First-run experience and the Splash screen will be shown.

Note: The specific configuration options shown to the user in the First Run Experience, can also be managed by using other specific policies. You can use the HideFirstRunExperience policy in combination with these policies to configure a specific browser experience on your managed devices. Some of these other policies are:

- If you enable this policy the one-time redirection dialog and banner will never be shown to users. Users' browsing data will not be imported when a redirection happens.

- If you disable or don't set this policy, the redirection dialog will be shown on the first redirection and the persistent redirection banner will be shown to users on sessions that begin with a redirection. Users' browsing data will be imported every time user encounters such redirection (ONLY IF user consents to it on the one-time dialog).</string><string id="HideRestoreDialogEnabled">Hide restore pages dialog after browser crash</string><string id="HideRestoreDialogEnabled_Explain">This policy gives an option to hide the &quot;Restore pages&quot; dialog after Microsoft Edge has crashed. The &quot;Restore pages&quot; dialog gives users the option to restore the pages that were previously open before Microsoft Edge crashed.

If you enable this policy, the &quot;Restore pages&quot; dialog will not be shown. In the event of a crash, Microsoft Edge will not restore previous tabs and will start the session with a new tab page.

If you disable or don't set this policy, the &quot;Restore pages&quot; dialog will be shown.

If you set this policy, do not set the 'ClearBrowsingDataOnExit' (Clear browsing data when Microsoft Edge closes) or 'SavingBrowserHistoryDisabled' (Disable saving browser history) policy since that prevents history from being saved which also disables the dialog.</string><string id="HttpAllowlist">HTTP Allowlist</string><string id="HttpAllowlist_Explain">Setting the policy specifies a list of hostnames or hostname patterns (such as '[*.]example.com') that will not be upgraded to HTTPS and will not show an error interstitial if HTTPS-First Mode is enabled. Organizations can use this policy to maintain access to servers that do not support HTTPS, without needing to disable 'AutomaticHttpsDefault' (Configure Automatic HTTPS).

Supplied hostnames must be canonicalized: Any IDNs must be converted to their A-label format, and all ASCII letters must be lowercase.

Blanket host wildcards (i.e., &quot;*&quot; or &quot;[*]&quot;) are not allowed. Instead, HTTPS-First Mode and HTTPS Upgrades should be explicitly disabled via their specific policies.

You should configure this policy if you want to capture the contents of Internet Explorer mode tabs. However, enabling this policy may negatively impact performance when capturing browser windows in the same process.

This policy only affects window capture, not tab capture. The contents of Internet Explorer mode tabs will not be captured when you choose to capture only a single tab, even if you configure this policy.

If you enable this policy, Microsoft Edge will always use the OS capture engine for window capture. Internet Explorer mode tabs will have their contents captured.

If you disable or don't configure this policy, Microsoft Edge will use the Browser capture engine for browser windows in the same process. Internet Explorer mode tabs in these windows will not have their contents captured.

This allows Internet Explorer plugins like ActiveX controls to perform additional critical work even after the browser has been closed. However, this can cause stability and performance issues, and Microsoft Edge processes may remain active in the background with no visible windows if the webpage or plugin prevents Internet Explorer from unloading. This policy should only be used if your organization depends on a plugin that requires this behavior.

If you enable this policy, Microsoft Edge will always wait for Internet Explorer mode tabs to fully unload before ending the browser session.

The user must be signed into Microsoft Edge with a valid work or school account for reports to be sent, and the user's account tenant must match the tenant specified by the policy.

If you configure this policy, Microsoft Edge will send a report to the M365 Admin Center Site Lists app when a navigation appears stuck redirecting back and forth between the Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer engines several times. This usually indicates that redirection to an authentication server is switching engines, which repeatedly fails in a loop. The report will show the URL of the site that is the redirect target, minus any query string or fragment. The user's identity isn't reported.

For this reporting to work correctly, you must have successfully visited the Microsoft Edge Site Lists app in the M365 Admin Center at least once. This activates a per-tenant storage account used to store these reports. Microsoft Edge will still attempt to send reports if this step hasn't been completed. However, the reports will not be stored in the Site Lists app.

When enabling this policy, you must specify your O365 tenant ID. To learn more about finding your O365 tenant ID, see https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2185668

After a site has been reloaded in Internet Explorer mode, &quot;in-page&quot; navigations will stay in Internet Explorer mode (for example, a link, script, or form on the page, or a server-side redirect from another &quot;in-page&quot; navigation). Users can choose to exit from Internet Explorer mode, or Microsoft Edge will automatically exit from Internet Explorer mode when a navigation that isn't &quot;in-page&quot; occurs (for example, using the address bar, the back button, or a favorite link).

Users can also optionally tell Microsoft Edge to use Internet Explorer mode for the site in the future. This choice will be remembered for a length of time managed by the 'InternetExplorerIntegrationLocalSiteListExpirationDays' (Specify the number of days that a site remains on the local IE mode site list) policy.

If this policy isn't configured, the browser will use the default behavior of DNS interception checks and intranet redirect suggestions. In M88, they are enabled by default but will be disabled by default in the future release.

'DNSInterceptionChecksEnabled' (DNS interception checks enabled) is a related policy that might also disable DNS interception checks. However, this policy is a more flexible version which might separately control intranet redirection infobars and might be expanded in the future.
If either 'DNSInterceptionChecksEnabled' or this policy make a request to disable interception checks, the checks will be disabled.
If DNS interception checks are disabled by this policy but 'GoToIntranetSiteForSingleWordEntryInAddressBar' (Force direct intranet site navigation instead of searching on single word entries in the Address Bar) is enabled, single word queries will still result in intranet navigations.

Live captions is an accessibility feature that converts speech from the audio that plays in Microsoft Edge in to text and shows this text in a separate window. The entire process happens on the device and no audio or caption text ever leaves the device.

Note: This feature is not generally available. Clients that have the 'ExperimentationAndConfigurationServiceControl' (Control communication with the Experimentation and Configuration Service) policy set to 'FullMode' may receive the feature before broad availability. Broad availability will be announced via Microsoft Edge release notes.

If you enable or don't configure this policy, users can turn this feature on or off at edge://settings/accessibility.

If you disable this policy, users will not be able to turn this accessibility feature on. If speech recognition files have been downloaded previously, they will be deleted from the device in 30 days. We recommend avoiding this option unless it's needed in your environment.

If users choose to turn on Live captions, speech recognition files (approximately 100 megabytes) will be downloaded to the device on first run and then periodically to improve performance and accuracy.

The policy creates a list of favorites. Each favorite contains the keys &quot;name&quot; and &quot;url,&quot; which hold the favorite's name and its target. You can configure a subfolder by defining a favorites without an &quot;url&quot; key but with an additional &quot;children&quot; key that contains a list of favorites as defined above (some of which may be folders again). Microsoft Edge amends incomplete URLs as if they were submitted via the Address Bar, for example &quot;microsoft.com&quot; becomes &quot;https://microsoft.com/&quot;.

These favorites are placed in a folder that can't be modified by the user (but the user can choose to hide it from the favorites bar). By default the folder name is &quot;Managed favorites&quot; but you can change it by adding to the list of favorites a dictionary containing the key &quot;toplevel_name&quot; with the desired folder name as the value.

Managed favorites are not synced to the user account and can't be modified by extensions.

Starting in Microsoft Edge version 100, you can configure up to 100 engines.

You do not need to specify the encoding. Starting in Microsoft Edge 80, the suggest_url and image_search_url parameters are optional. The optional parameter, image_search_post_params (consists of comma-separated name/value pairs), is available starting in Microsoft Edge 80.

Starting in Microsoft Edge 83, you can enable search engine discovery with the optional allow_search_engine_discovery parameter. This parameter must be the first item in the list. If allow_search_engine_discovery isn't specified, search engine discovery will be disabled by default. Starting in Microsoft Edge 84, you can set this policy as a recommended policy to allow search provider discovery. You don't need to add the optional allow_search_engine_discovery parameter. Starting in Microsoft Edge 100, setting this policy as a recommended policy will also allow users to manually add new search engines from their Microsoft Edge settings.

If you enable this policy, users can't add, remove, or change any search engine in the list. Users can set their default search engine to any search engine in the list.

If you disable or don't configure this policy, users can modify the search engines list as desired.

If the 'DefaultSearchProviderSearchURL' (Default search provider search URL) policy is set, this policy (ManagedSearchEngines) is ignored. The user must restart their browser to finish applying this policy.

Tabs will not wait longer than this timeout for the Enterprise Mode Site List to download. If the browser has not finished downloading the Enterprise Mode Site List when the timeout expires, Microsoft Edge tabs will continue navigating anyway. The value of the timeout should be no greater than 20 seconds and no fewer than 1 second.

If you set the timeout in this policy to a value greater than 2 seconds, an information bar is shown to the user after 2 seconds. The information bar contains a button that allows the user to quit waiting for the Enterprise Mode Site List download to complete.

If this policy is enabled, the network service process will run sandboxed.
If this policy is disabled, the network service process will run unsandboxed. This leaves users open to additional security risks related to running the network service unsandboxed.
If this policy is not set, the default configuration for the network sandbox will be used. This may vary depending on Microsoft Edge release, currently running field trials, and platform.
This policy is intended to give enterprises flexibility to disable the network sandbox if they use third party software that interferes with the network service sandbox.</string><string id="NewBaseUrlInheritanceBehaviorAllowed">Allows enabling the feature NewBaseUrlInheritanceBehavior (deprecated)</string><string id="NewBaseUrlInheritanceBehaviorAllowed_Explain">DEPRECATED: This policy is deprecated. It is currently supported but will become obsolete in a future release.

NewBaseUrlInheritanceBehavior is a Microsoft Edge feature that causes about:blank and about:srcdoc frames to consistently inherit their base url values via snapshots of their initiator's base url.

If you disable this policy, it prevents users or Microsoft Edge variations from enabling NewBaseUrlInheritanceBehavior, in case compatibility issues are discovered.

If you enable or don't configure this policy, it allows enabling NewBaseUrlInheritanceBehavior.

This has security implications because an origin-keyed agent cluster allows isolating documents by origin. The consequence of this for developers is that the document.domain accessor can no longer be set when origin-keyed agent clustering is enabled.

If you enable or don't configure this policy, documents without the Origin-Agent-Cluster: header will be assigned to origin-keyed agent clustering by default. On these documents, the document.domain accessor will not be settable.

This policy lets you specify allowed origins for legacy applications that can't deploy TLS or set up a staging server for internal web development so that developers can test out features requiring secure contexts without having to deploy TLS on the staging server. This policy also prevents the origin from being labeled &quot;Not Secure&quot; in the omnibox.

Setting a list of URLs in this policy has the same effect as setting the command-line flag '--unsafely-treat-insecure-origin-as-secure' to a comma-separated list of the same URLs. If you enable this policy, it overrides the command-line flag.

This will be the new PDF viewer architecture going forward, as it is simpler in design and makes adding new features easier. The current GuestView PDF viewer, which relies on an outdated and overly complex architecture, is being deprecated.

When this policy is set to Enabled or not set, Microsoft Edge will use the OOPIF PDF viewer architecture. Once Enabled or not set, the default behavior will be decided by Microsoft Edge.

When this policy is set to Disabled, Microsoft Edge will strictly use the existing GuestView PDF viewer. This approach embeds a web page with its own separate frame tree into another web page.

This lets supporting servers protect user traffic from being decrypted by quantum computers.

If you enable this policy, Microsoft Edge will offer a post-quantum key agreement in TLS connections. TLS connections will be protected from quantum computers when communicating with compatible servers.

If you disable this policy, Microsoft Edge will not offer a post-quantum key agreement in TLS connections. User traffic will be unprotected from decryption by quantum computers.

If you don't configure this policy, Microsoft Edge will follow the default rollout process for offering a post-quantum key agreement.

Offering a post-quantum key agreement is backwards-compatible. Existing TLS servers and networking middleware are expected to ignore the new option and continue selecting previous options.

However, devices that don't implement TLS correctly may malfunction when offered the new option. For example, they might disconnect in response to unrecognized options or the resulting larger messages. These devices are not post-quantum-ready and will interfere with an enterprise's post-quantum transition. If this issue is encountered, administrators should contact the vendor for a fix.

This policy is a temporary measure and will be removed in future versions of Microsoft Edge.

It is currently supported but will become obsolete in a future release.

This policy is deprecated because RSAKeyUsageForLocalAnchorsEnabled feature has been removed.

This policy will be removed in version 133.

The X.509 key usage extension declares how the key in a certificate can be
used. These instructions ensure certificates aren't used in an unintended
context, which protects against a class of cross-protocol attacks on HTTPS and
other protocols. HTTPS clients must verify that server certificates match the
connection's TLS parameters.

Starting in Microsoft Edge 124, this
check is always enabled.

Microsoft Edge 123 and earlier have the
following behavior:

If this policy is set to enabled,
Microsoft Edge will perform this key
check. This helps prevent attacks where an attacker manipulates the browser into
interpreting a key in ways that the certificate owner did not intend.

If this policy is set to disabled,
Microsoft Edge will skip this key check in
HTTPS connections that negotiate TLS 1.2 and use an RSA certificate that
chains to a local trust anchor. Examples of local trust anchors include
policy-provided or user-installed root certificates. In all other cases, the
check is performed independent of this policy's setting.

If this policy is not configured,
Microsoft Edge will behave as if the
policy is enabled.

This policy is available for administrators to preview the behavior of a
future release, which will enable this check by default. At that point, this
policy will remain temporarily available for administrators that need more
time to update their certificates to meet the new RSA key usage requirements.

Connections that fail this check will fail with the error
ERR_SSL_KEY_USAGE_INCOMPATIBLE. Sites that fail with this error likely have a
misconfigured certificate. Modern ECDHE_RSA cipher suites use the
&quot;digitalSignature&quot; key usage option, while legacy RSA decryption cipher suites
use the &quot;keyEncipherment&quot; key usage option. If uncertain, administrators should
include both in RSA certificates meant for HTTPS.</string><string id="ReadAloudEnabled">Enable Read Aloud feature in Microsoft Edge</string><string id="ReadAloudEnabled_Explain">Enables the Read Aloud feature within Microsoft Edge.

If you disable this policy, users can't access the Read Aloud feature from the address bar, right click context menu, more menu, on the PDF toolbar, and within Immersive Reader.</string><string id="RedirectSitesFromInternetExplorerPreventBHOInstall">Prevent install of the BHO to redirect incompatible sites from Internet Explorer to Microsoft Edge</string><string id="RedirectSitesFromInternetExplorerPreventBHOInstall_Explain">This setting lets you specify whether to block the install of the Browser Helper Object (BHO) that enables redirecting incompatible sites from Internet Explorer to Microsoft Edge for sites that require a modern browser.

If you enable this policy, the BHO will not be installed. If it is already installed it will be uninstalled on the next Microsoft Edge update.

If this policy is not configured or is disabled, the BHO will be installed.

The BHO is required for incompatible site redirection to occur, however whether redirection occurs or not is also controlled by 'RedirectSitesFromInternetExplorerRedirectMode' (Redirect incompatible sites from Internet Explorer to Microsoft Edge).

If you set this policy to 'Disable' ('Prevent redirection', value 0), Internet Explorer will not redirect any traffic to Microsoft Edge.

If you set this policy to 'Sitelist', starting with Microsoft Edge major release 87 , Internet Explorer (IE) will redirect sites that require a modern browser to Microsoft Edge. (Note: The Sitelist setting is 'Redirect sites based on the incompatible sites sitelist', value 1).

When a site is redirected from Internet Explorer to Microsoft Edge, the Internet Explorer tab that started loading the site is closed if it had no prior content. Otherwise, the user is taken to a Microsoft help page that explains why the site was redirected to Microsoft Edge. When Microsoft Edge is launched to load an IE site, an information bar explains that the site works best in a modern browser.

If you want to redirect all navigations, you can configure the Disable Internet Explorer 11 policy, which redirects all navigations from IE11 to Microsoft Edge. It also hides the IE11 app icon from the user after the first launch.

If don't configure this policy:
  - Starting with Microsoft Edge major release 87, you will have the same experience as setting the policy to 'Sitelist': Internet Explorer will redirect sites that require a modern browser to Microsoft Edge.
  - In the future, the default for your organization might change to automatically redirect all navigations. If you don't want automatic redirection, set this policy to 'Disable' or 'Sitelist'.

For more information about this policy see  https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2141715

If you don't configure this policy, Microsoft Edge adds a recycle icon at the far right of the top menu bar to prompt users to restart the browser to apply the update.

If you enable this policy and set it to 'Recommended', a recurring warning prompts users that a restart is recommended. Users can dismiss this warning and defer the restart.

If you set the policy to 'Required', a recurring warning prompts users that the browser will be restarted automatically as soon as a notification period passes. The default period is seven days. You can configure this period with the 'RelaunchNotificationPeriod' (Set the time period for update notifications) policy.

The user's session is restored when the browser restarts.

Users are notified of the need for a browser relaunch or device restart based on the 'RelaunchNotification' (Notify a user that a browser restart is recommended or required for pending updates) and 'RelaunchNotificationPeriod' (Set the time period for update notifications) policy settings. Browsers and devices are forcibly restarted at the end of the notification period when the 'RelaunchNotification' policy is set to 'Required'. This RelaunchWindow policy can be used to defer the end of the notification period so that it falls within a specific time window.

If you don't configure this policy, the default target time window is the whole day (i.e., the end of the notification period is never deferred).

Event dispatching on disabled form controls is being changed in Edge to improve compatibility with other browsers and to improve the developer experience.

With this change, MouseEvents get dispatched on disabled form control elements. Exceptions for this behavior are click, mouseup, and mousedown. Some examples of the new events are mousemove, mouseenter, and mouseleave.

This change also truncates the event path of click, mouseup, and mousedown when they’re dispatched on children of disabled form controls. These events aren’t dispatched on the disabled form control or any of its ancestors.

Note: This new behavior might break some websites.

Format the URL pattern according to https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2095322.

You can use this policy to open exceptions to restrictive block lists. For example, you can include '*' in the block list to block all requests, and then use this policy to allow access to a limited list of URLs. You can use this policy to open exceptions to certain schemes, subdomains of other domains, ports, or specific paths.

The most specific filter determines if a URL is blocked or allowed. The allowed list takes precedence over the block list.

This policy is limited to 1000 entries; subsequent entries are ignored.

This policy also allows the browser to automatically invoke external applications registered as protocol handlers for protocols like &quot;tel:&quot; or &quot;ssh:&quot;.

If you don't configure this policy, there are no exceptions to the block list in the 'URLBlocklist' policy.

You can define exceptions in the 'URLAllowlist' (Define a list of allowed URLs) policy. These policies are limited to 1000 entries; subsequent entries are ignored.

Note that blocking internal 'edge://*' URLs isn't recommended - this may lead to unexpected errors.

This policy doesn't prevent the page from updating dynamically through JavaScript. For example, if you block 'contoso.com/abc', users might still be able to visit 'contoso.com' and click on a link to visit 'contoso.com/abc', as long as the page doesn't refresh.

It is currently supported but will become obsolete in a future release.

This policy is deprecated because it is a temporary policy for web standards compliance. It won't work in Microsoft Edge as soon as version 107.
If you enable this policy, the JavaScript setTimeout and setInterval, with an interval smaller than 4ms, will not be clamped. This improves short horizon performance, but websites abusing the API will still eventually have their setTimeout usages clamped.
If you disable or don't configure policy, the JavaScript setTimeout and setInterval, with an interval smaller than 4ms, will be clamped.

This is a web standards compliancy feature that may change task ordering on a web page, leading to unexpected behavior on sites that are dependent on a certain ordering.
It also may affect sites with a lot of usage of a timeout of 0ms for setTimeout. For example, increasing CPU load.</string><string id="UploadFromPhoneEnabled">Enable upload files from mobile in Microsoft Edge desktop</string><string id="UploadFromPhoneEnabled_Explain">This policy lets you configure the &quot;Upload from mobile&quot; feature in Microsoft Edge.

When enabled, the User-Agent Client Hints GREASE Update feature aligns the User-Agent GREASE algorithm with the latest version from the specification.  The updated specification may break some websites that restrict the characters that requests may contain. For more information, see the following specification: https://wicg.github.io/ua-client-hints/#grease

If this policy is enabled or not configured, the User-Agent GREASE algorithm from the specification will be used. If the policy is disabled, the prior User-Agent GREASE algorithm will be used.

If you disable this policy or don't configure it, WebRTC will not consider the routing table and may make peer to peer connections over any available network.

If you enable this policy, WebRTC will prefer to make peer to peer connections using the indicated network interface for the remote address as indicated in the routing table.

This policy was removed in Microsoft Edge 124 and is ignored if set.

WebSQL is on by default as of Microsoft Edge version 101, but can be disabled via a Microsoft Edge flag.
If you enable this policy, WebSQL cannot be disabled.
If you disable or don't configure this policy, WebSQL can be disabled.</string><string id="WebSQLInThirdPartyContextEnabled">Force WebSQL in third-party contexts to be re-enabled (obsolete)</string><string id="WebSQLInThirdPartyContextEnabled_Explain">OBSOLETE: This policy is obsolete and doesn't work after Microsoft Edge 100.

This policy is obsolete because it was intended to be a short-term mechanism to give enterprises more time to update their web content when it's found to be incompatible with the change to disable WebSQL in third-party contexts. It doesn't work in Microsoft Edge after version 100.

WebSQL in third-party contexts (for example, cross-site iframes) is off by default as of Microsoft Edge version 97 and was fully removed in version 101.

If you enable this policy, WebSQL in third-party contexts will be re-enabled.

If you disable this policy or don't configure it, WebSQL in third-party contexts will stay off.</string><string id="WebSQLNonSecureContextEnabled">Force WebSQL in non-secure contexts to be enabled (obsolete)</string><string id="WebSQLNonSecureContextEnabled_Explain">OBSOLETE: This policy is obsolete and doesn't work after Microsoft Edge 112.

This policy doesn't work because WebSQL in non-secure contexts is on by default as of Microsoft Edge 105.
If you enable this policy, WebSQL in non-secure contexts will be enabled.
If you disable or don't configure this policy, WebSQL in non-secure contexts will follow the default settings of the browser.

This policy was removed in Microsoft Edge 113 and is ignored if configured.</string><string id="WebSelectEnabled">Web Select Enabled (obsolete)</string><string id="WebSelectEnabled_Explain">OBSOLETE: This policy is obsolete and doesn't work after Microsoft Edge 116.

This policy is obsoleted because Web Select is part of Web Capture and can be controlled by 'WebCaptureEnabled' (Enable the Screenshot (previously named Web Capture) feature in Microsoft Edge). This policy won't work in Microsoft Edge version 117. If Web Capture is disabled by 'WebCaptureEnabled', Web select will not be available in Web Capture.

Web select lets users select and copy web content while preserving its formatting when pasted in most cases. It also allows more targeted selection on some web elements, such as copying a single column in a table.

If you enable or don't configure this policy, Web select is available in Web Capture and can be accessed directly using the CTRL+SHIFT+X keyboard shortcut.

If you disable this policy, Web select will not be available in Web Capture and the CTRL+SHIFT+X keyboard shortcut will also not work.</string><string id="WebWidgetAllowed">Enable the Search bar (deprecated)</string><string id="WebWidgetAllowed_Explain">DEPRECATED: This policy is deprecated. It is currently supported but will become obsolete in a future release.

Enables the search bar. When enabled, users can use the search bar to search the web from their desktop or from an application. The search bar provides a search box that shows web suggestions and opens all web searches in Microsoft Edge. The search box provides search (powered by Bing) and URL suggestions. The search bar can be launched  from the &quot;More tools&quot; menu or jump list in Microsoft Edge.

If you enable or don't configure this policy:
The search bar will be automatically enabled for all profiles.
The option to enable the search bar at startup will be toggled on if the 'WebWidgetIsEnabledOnStartup' (Allow the Search bar at Windows startup) policy is enabled.
If the 'WebWidgetIsEnabledOnStartup' is disabled or not configured, the option to enable the search bar at startup will be toggled off.
Users will see the menu item to launch the search bar from the Microsoft Edge &quot;More tools&quot; menu. Users can launch the search bar from &quot;More tools&quot;.
Users will see the menu item to launch the search bar from the Microsoft Edge jump list menu. Users can launch the search bar from the Microsoft Edge jump list menu.
The search bar can be turned off by the &quot;Quit&quot; option in the System tray or by closing the search bar from the 3 dot menu. The search bar will be restarted on system reboot if auto-start is enabled.


If you disable this policy:
The search bar will be disabled for all profiles.
The option to launch the search bar from Microsoft Edge &quot;More tools&quot; menu will be disabled.
The option to launch the search bar from Microsoft Edge jump list menu will be disabled.

This policy is deprecated due to the deprecation of the Web widget's vertical layout. This policy will be made obsolete in 119 release.</string><string id="WebWidgetIsEnabledOnStartup">Allow the Search bar at Windows startup (obsolete)</string><string id="WebWidgetIsEnabledOnStartup_Explain">OBSOLETE: This policy is obsolete and doesn't work after Microsoft Edge 119.

This policy is obsolete due to the deprecation of the Web widget, which is now known as Edge search bar. Admins should use SearchbarIsEnabledOnStartup for Edge search bar instead. Allows the Search bar to start running at Windows startup.

If you enable this policy the Search bar will start running at Windows startup by default. If the Search bar is disabled via 'WebWidgetAllowed' (Enable the Search bar) policy, this policy will not start the Search bar on Windows startup.

If you disable this policy, the Search bar will not start at Windows startup for all profiles. The option to start the Edge search bar at Windows startup will be disabled and toggled off in Microsoft Edge settings.

If you don't configure this policy, the Search bar will not start at Windows startup for all profiles. The option to start the Edge search bar at Windows startup will be toggled off in Microsoft Edge settings.</string><string id="WinHttpProxyResolverEnabled">Use Windows proxy resolver</string><string id="WinHttpProxyResolverEnabled_Explain">This policy will be superseded by a similar feature in a future release. For more information, see https://crbug.com/1032820.

Use Windows to resolve proxies for all browser networking instead of the proxy resolver built into Microsoft Edge. The Windows proxy resolver enables Windows proxy features such as DirectAccess/NRPT.

This policy comes with the problems described by https://crbug.com/644030. It causes PAC files to be fetched and executed by Windows code, including PAC files set via the 'ProxyPacUrl' (Set the proxy .pac file URL) policy. Since Network Fetches for the PAC file happen via Windows instead of Microsoft Edge code, network policies such as 'DnsOverHttpsMode' (Control the mode of DNS-over-HTTPS) will not apply to network fetches for a PAC file.

If you enable this policy, the Windows proxy resolver will be used.

If you disable or don't configure this policy, the Microsoft Edge proxy resolver will be used.</string><string id="WindowOcclusionEnabled">Enable Window Occlusion</string><string id="WindowOcclusionEnabled_Explain">Enables window occlusion in Microsoft Edge.

If you enable this setting, to reduce CPU and power consumption Microsoft Edge will detect when a window is covered by other windows, and will suspend work painting pixels.

If you disable this setting Microsoft Edge will not detect when a window is covered by other windows.

If this policy is left not set, window hiding detection will be enabled.</string><string id="SUPPORTED_WIN7_V128">Microsoft Edge version 128, Windows 7 or later</string><string
